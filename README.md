# CUDA Ladder — My Path from Zero to GPU Mastery

> A personal, public project where I learn **CUDA step by step** and document everything I discover.
> Each folder inside `/projects` is a mini-lab — small, focused, and measurable.
> I’ll compare **CPU vs GPU performances**, track improvements, and end with my own fine-tuned LLM.

## What This Repo Is About

- Learning CUDA **hands-on** (C++ and Python)
- Building a **series of small GPU projects**
- Measuring performance between CPU and GPU
- Understanding **how and why** GPUs accelerate code
- Finishing with a **custom domain-tuned LLM (probably QLoRA/SFT)**
